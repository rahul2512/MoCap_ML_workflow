# learning curve data 
# code to reproduce this data is in main python notebook
# For each model, we have created learning curve by first training the model
# 10, 30, and 50% on one sample data and then 1-13 samples.
# For each case, we have done 10 independent runs either choosing different samples or random initial message,
